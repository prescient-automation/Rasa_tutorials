Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contexual assistants on:

Facebook Messenger
Slack
Google Hangouts
Webex Teams
Microsoft Bot Framework
Rocket.Chat
Mattermost
Telegram
Twilio
Your own custom conversational channels
or voice assistants as:

Alexa Skills
Google Home Actions
Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously discussed â€“ Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.

There's a lot more background information in this blog post.
